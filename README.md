# TaskManagementSystem
Project Overview
This project is a Task Management System designed and implemented using AWS Serverless Services. The system enables efficient task management for a field team, allowing:
•	Admins to create, assign, and manage tasks.
•	Team Members to view and update their assigned tasks.
•	Real-time notifications, status updates, and deadline tracking to ensure a seamless workflow.
The system leverages the scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of serverless architecture to handle tasks efficiently.

Features
1. Admin Features
•	Task Creation: Admins can create tasks, specifying details such as title, description, priority, and deadline.
 
•	Task Assignment: Admins can assign tasks to specific team members.
•	Task Monitoring: Admins have an overview of all tasks, including their status, deadlines, and team assignments.
 
2. Team Member Features
•	Task Dashboard: Team members log in to view their assigned tasks.
 
•	Task Updates: Team members can update the status of their tasks (e.g., "In Progress", "Completed").
•	Notifications: Team members receive alerts for new tasks, approaching deadlines, and updates.
 
3. Core System Features
•	Real-time Notifications: Using AWS SNS and Lambda for instant alerts.
•	Status Updates: Task progress tracked and updated in real time.
•	Deadline Tracking: Automated reminders for upcoming or missed deadlines.
•	Secure Access: Role-based authentication and authorization.

Architecture
The system uses AWS Serverless Services, ensuring scalability, low maintenance, and cost-effectiveness. The architecture includes:
AWS Services
1.	Amazon API Gateway
o	Provides RESTful endpoints for admin and team member interactions.
2.	Amazon DynamoDB
o	Stores task data, user information, and status updates.
3.	Amazon Cognito
o	Manages user authentication and role-based authorization.
4.	AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS)
o	Sends notifications for task updates and deadlines.
5.	AWS CloudWatch
o	Monitors application performance and logs errors.
6.	AWS S3 (Optional)
o	Stores static files or task-related documents.

Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
•	AWS Account
•	Node.js installed locally
•	AWS CLI configured
•	Visual Studio Code 
Steps
1.	Clone the Repository:
2.	git clone task-management-system
cd task-management-system
3.	Install Dependencies:
npm install
4.	Deploy AWS Resources:
o	Use the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) or AWS CDK.
o	Example deployment with SAM:
sam deploy --guided
5.	Configure Environment Variables: Update config.js with required AWS resource identifiers (DynamoDB table name, SNS topic ARN, etc.).
6.	Run the Application: Access the API endpoints through the deployed API Gateway URL.
